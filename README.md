This repository contains the code for the paper **"Efficient Cross-Regional Spatial Dataset Search with Kernel Density Estimation"**. This research proposes a dataset retrieval scheme aimed at addressing the challenge of discovering datasets with similar distribution patterns in cross-regional scenarios.


## 🖼️ System Overview

The following figure illustrates the DPSS+ framework, which is bifurcated into an offline processing stage for repository indexing and an online query stage for rapid similarity retrieval.

* **(a) Data Modeling**: Raw spatial points are normalized to mitigate geographic offsets and transformed into continuous probability fields using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
* **(b) Dimension Reduction**: Grid cells are mapped to a one-dimensional sequence using Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality.
* **(c) Index Construction**: A balanced binary search tree (HBT-index) is built based on Hilbert-compressed representations.
* **(d) Coarse-grained Filtering**: Chebyshev’s inequality is used to prune dissimilar candidates efficiently by calculating potential upper and lower bounds.
* **(e) Fine-grained Matching**: The Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is calculated for the remaining candidates to find the Top-k results.

## 🛠️ Experiment Settings

### 1. Default Parameters
The system's performance is governed by several key parameters defined in the `Test_Optimized.java` file:

| Parameter | Meaning | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `θ`  | Grid resolution parameter ($2^\theta \times 2^\theta$) | 7 |
| `α`  | Bandwidth-density sensitivity parameter | 0.2 |
| `λ`  | Filtering threshold parameter for HBT-index | 0.6 |
| `k` | Number of top similar datasets to return | 5 |

### 2. Dataset Repositories
The experiments are conducted on three real-world repositories:
* **Identifiable**: Precise addresses of buildings and POIs.
* **Public**: Large-scale public geographic databases.
* **Trackable**: GPS trajectories of mobile targets.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 or higher.
* At least 16GB of RAM (128GB recommended for full-scale 100k dataset tests).

### 2. Configuration
Before running the program, you must update the local data path in `src/Similarity_Model/Test_Optimized.java`:

```java
// Modify this line to point to your local dataset directory
String directoryPath = "C:\\Your\\Path\\To\\Datasets";
